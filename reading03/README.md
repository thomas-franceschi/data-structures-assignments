==========

1. Tree **A** is the only max-heap. Tree B is not a max-heap because 
it has "16" as a parent of "17", and in a max-heap the parent must 
always be larger than the child node. Tree C is not a max heap because 
it has "19" as a parent of "27" and is not a max-heap for the same 
reason as tree B.

2. The purpose of reheapification is to ensure that the values being 
entered to the heap are placed in the correct order, sorting the list 
on insertion to save time later. The complexity is O(n).
